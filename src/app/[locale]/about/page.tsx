              JudgeGPT is a research project focused on critically evaluating
              news content generated by AI, exploring the nuanced perceptions of
              authenticity in machine-generated vs. human-generated news. This
              pioneering work aims to gather insights on how individuals discern
              between real and artificial news content in an era of rapidly
              advancing language models. üîç Want to test your judgment? If
              you're interested in seeing this application in action and would
              like to participate in the evaluation of fake news, please visit
              our interactive survey at https://judgegpt.streamlit.app/. A port
              to React is currently in development, and can be beta tested at
              https://aka.ms/JudgeGPT. üß† Curious about spotting fake news? If
